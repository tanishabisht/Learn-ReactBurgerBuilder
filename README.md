# Burger Builder React Application
This application is my goto guide for best practices in React.

## Folder Structure
- public
  - favicon.ico
  - index.html
- src
  - Components
    - Burger
  - Container
    - Layout
      - Navbar
      - Layout
  - Hoc (Higher Order Components)
    - Aux (Similar to React.Fragment)
  - Pages

## Best Practices
- Components should have these two important properties:
  - Modularity
  - Reusability
- Prop Type Validation
- Proper Segregation for Components managing state
- Add handler as a suffix to event based functions

## Stacks Used
`css modules` `Materialize` `prop-types`
